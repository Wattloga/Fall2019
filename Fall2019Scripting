Once again redoing this. I am recording the daily weather temperatures.
Yesterday, August 24, 2019 I recorded thatthe temperature at 10:00 am was 65 degrees.
I came back to check in a little later in the day to see the temperature difference. 
Around 6 pm it was recorded at 93 degrees. It was a sunny day with little to no clouds.
The wind was low, and it was pretty hot outside.
